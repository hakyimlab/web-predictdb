# PredictDB Data Repository

## Welcome

Here you can find transcriptome prediction models for the PrediXcan family of methods: S-PrediXcan, MultiXcan and S-MultiXcan.

.db files are prediction models, usable by all methods. .txt.gz files are compilations of LD reference for summary-based methods (S- prefix). S-PrediXcan is meant to use the single-tissue LD reference files ("covariances") appropriate to each model. S-MultiXcan uses single-tissue prediction models and a cross-tissue LD reference.
