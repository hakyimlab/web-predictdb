We are happy to announce the release of new and improved Transcriptome Prediction Models, based off GTEx expression data trained on 1000 Genomes. The models (and associated covariance matrices) can be downloaded from [PredictDB Data Repository](http://predictdb.org/). A more comprehensive explanation of the model changes is available at [PrediXcan Wiki](https://github.com/hakyimlab/PrediXcan/wiki). We will send out an email to the group once these models are made available at [PredictDB Data Repository](http://predictdb.org/), so keep an eye out in the coming days. Cheers!
