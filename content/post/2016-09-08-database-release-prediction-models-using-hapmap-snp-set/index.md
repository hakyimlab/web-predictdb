After numerous requests, we have now made our prediction models using HapMap SNPs available. These are models trained on [GTEx's V6p data](http://www.gtexportal.org/), but filtered to include HapMap SNPs only. These may prove beneficial to your analysis if you are working with older data or if you are having to impute much of your genotype data in order to achieve more complete coverage with 1000 Genomes. Detailed descriptions of the databases can be found in the README files.
