Single-tissue expression prediction models with LD reference data are available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/laurahuckins/CMC_DLPFC_prediXcan). The underlying algorithm is Elastic Net.

These models were presented in ["Gene expression imputation across multiple brain regions provides insights into schizophrenia risk](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0364-4), Huckins et al, 2019, Nature Genetics. Please cite if you find these useful.
