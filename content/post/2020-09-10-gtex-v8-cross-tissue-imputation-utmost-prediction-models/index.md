Prediction models trained with GTEx V8 data using the cross tissue imputation approach ([see UTMOST paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6788740/)). Trained by Alvaro Barbeira for the paper [Fine‐mapping and QTL tissue‐sharing information improves the reliability of causal gene identification](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7693040/)
