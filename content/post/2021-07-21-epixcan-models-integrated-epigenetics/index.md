Expression prediction models with LD reference data are available in this [website](https://zhangw17.u.hpc.mssm.edu/epixcan/about.php#dl). The models were trained on Common Mind Consortium, GTEx, and STARNET consortiums. The underlying algorithm is Elastic Net, informed by epigenetic data.

These models were presented in ["Integrative transcriptome imputation reveals tissue-specific and shared biological mechanisms mediating susceptibility to complex traits"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11874-7), Zhaneg et al, 2019, Nature Communications.
