For elastic net models, you can find a tutorial here(https://github.com/hakyimlab/PredictDB-Tutorial)

The newer GTEx v8 models were generaed with code available here. The documentation is still a work in progress, don't hesitate to use the PrediXcan/MetaXcan Google Group to ask for support. predixcanmetaxcan@googlegroups.com
