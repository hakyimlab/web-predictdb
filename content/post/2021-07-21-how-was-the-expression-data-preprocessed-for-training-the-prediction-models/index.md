A: We used the expression pre-processed by the GTEx analysis working group. Covariates are the same as used in the eQTL analysis. GTEx processing pipeline is here(https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/), and Docker image is here(https://hub.docker.com/r/broadinstitute/gtex_eqtl/).

-[ ] TODO: provide brief but complete details of this processing. Use supplement from GTEx 2020 Science paper.
