Single-tissue expression prediction models with LD reference data are available in this [Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/record/3610513#.XiCig-F7m90). The underlying algorithm is Elastic Net on MESA multi-ethnic cohort.

These models were presented in ["Genetic architecture of gene expression traits across diverse populations"](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007586), Mogil et al, 2018, PLOS Genetics. Please cite if you find these useful.
