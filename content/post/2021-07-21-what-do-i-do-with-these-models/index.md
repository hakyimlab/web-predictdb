These models allow prediction of gene expression or alternative splicing on a GWAS study. The predicted levels can be associated to a complex trait such as a disease's susceptibility. [PrediXcan implementation](https://github.com/hakyimlab/PrediXcan) uses these models and individual-level data. [MetaXcan repository](https://github.com/hakyimlab/MetaXcan) contains an implementation based on GWAS summary statistics (i.e. doesn't need individual-level data). Also, a multi-tissue association is implemented there both for individual-level and summary statistics-level data.
