Given the pervasive polygenicity of most complex traits, we found that TWAS results can be substantially inflated, yielding many more false positives than expected.
We describe the problem and solution in this [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.17.562831). We updated the MetaXcan software and prediction models to correct for this inflation. 

Find the new models [here](https://uchicago.box.com/s/w0nzszuvuwcsznvo8x4c15o4hujqrwm7) and a tutorial on how to use the updated method [here](https://github.com/hakyimlab/MetaXcan/wiki/S-PrediXcan-phi-inflation-correction).

The correction works with the latest MetaXcan Software v0.8.0 or later which can be downloaded from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/hakyimlab/MetaXcan/releases/tag/v0.8.0) or [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14113421)
