Given the pervasive polygenicity of most complex traits, we found that TWAS results can be substantially inflated, yielding many more false positives than expected.
We describe the problem and solution in this [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.17.562831). We updated the MetaXcan software and prediction models to correct for this inflation.
